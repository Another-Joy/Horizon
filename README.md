A collection of additions, changes and reworks made to the Horizon Zero Dawn Board Game with the intent of making it more challenging, deep and in line with the digital version.


### Current Reworks

Stealth - Added a suspected stage to Machines, as well as returning Machines while in stealth, rewarding patience and planning

Armor - Changed the armor system to not reward high damage outputs above everything else. Now armor is removable, rewarding team and tactical play.

Components - Reworked many Machines' components and added weakpoints, unarmored points that take bonus damage. Rewards planning and knowledge of Machines

Equipment - Rebalanced many of the Weapons, to better structure archetypes for each. Reworked some of the restrictions on equipment management.
