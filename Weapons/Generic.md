Ranged Weapons cannot be used to make attacks at 0 range, with the following exceptions:
- Slings: after rolling for damage, roll a black die. On a blank, you also take the damage if the sling has an AOE component, or your attack has no damage or effects if you are not attacking a huge machine.
- War Bows: if you are not attacking a Huge Machine, before rolling for damage, roll a black die. On a blank, your attack has no damage or effects. 

Whenever a weapon applies a Status Effect, that attack deals -50% damage. Before rolling, a player may choose to ignore any abilities that would apply status effects

Hunters can make 2 ranged attacks in the same turn, as long as those attacks use different weapons
