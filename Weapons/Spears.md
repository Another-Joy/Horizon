You can choose to remove armor from the target, or pierce it. Choose before rolling for damage.
- On remove, you deal no damage, but remove armor equal to the number of dice instead. If the target is [[Frozen]], remove twice that much armor instead.
- On pierce, you ignore armor on the target.

Some components cannot be targeted by Spears
