During any Campfire Phase, even before and during a merchant phase, you can:
- Trade equipment or non-personal item or cards with the other players. 
- Reorganize your equipment however you like
- Store any of your equipment or cards, or equip some from storage. You have infinite basic ammo in your storage (you can use from other players/decks if you need more).
