Now, between Alerted and Unalerted, Machines have a middle state: Suspected.

During this state, the Machine will investigate the source of it's suspicions, like the source of a shot, the end of a movement or a nearby sight. 

A suspected machine that has reached the source of it's suspicion will remain on that square for another activation, and then return to Unalerted and resume normal function.


If a Suspected machine would become Suspected again, it becomes Alerted.

The following events put a Machine on Suspected, from Unalerted:
- A hunter sprinted or is standing in an adjacent square
- A hunter is standing in its square, but it's a Tall Grass Square (the Machine will become alerted if neither Hunter or Machine exit this square until the its next activation)
- A hunter used a Distraction action (the machine makes the move as the distraction commands, but is put into the suspected state instead of the Unalerted) (Subsequent distractions do not cause a Machine to become Alerted)
- A hunter shot at the Machine, but only removed up to 1 Armor, dealt up to 1/10th of its health as damage (rounded up) and did not apply a condition. More that either of these and the Machine is Alerted.
- A machine in the same square is Suspected. This machine follows the same source of suspicion as the machine that caused it to become Suspected.
- Hard+ Exclusive - A machine on an adjacent square is alerted.
- Very Hard+ Exclusive - A machine on an adjacent square is suspected. This machine follows the same source of suspicion as the machine that caused it to become Suspected.

The following events put a Machine on Alerted from Unalerted, directly:
- A hunter sprinted in its square
- A hunter is standing in its square, and it's not a Tall Grass Square.
- A hunter shot at a Machine and removed 2 or more Armor, dealt more that 1/10th of its health as damage (rounded up) or applies a condition.
- A machine in the same square is Alerted
