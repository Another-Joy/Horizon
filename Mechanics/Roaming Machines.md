When a roaming machine leaves the map, it will return on the start of the path in whitch it left at the first possible time when both these conditions apply:
- There are no alerted Machines on the map
- There are no Hunters adjacent to the squares where the Machine will return.

If the machine did not return after 2 activations after the one where it left, it is considered lost
