All machines's armor is heavily increased, based on the [[Difficulty]].
Parts are not affected by the Machines's Armor, but can have Armor of their own.


Whenever an ranged attack hits a machine, remove an armor from it, and the attack deals 50%/33%/25% of its original damage, based on the [[Difficulty]]

If the machine is [[Frozen]], instead remove 3 armors from it. If there were less that 3 armors removed, the attack deal bonus damage (after damage reduction from armor):

| Counters removed | Damage bonus |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| 2                | +1           |
| 1                | +50%         |
| 0                | x2           |
