#### Part
Anything attached to the Machine, that is not it's main body. Components and Weakpoints are parts.

#### Component
Something that can be removed from the Machine. Each component has an effect when removed.

#### Weakpoint
A special place in a machine (usually) with no armor and that takes bonus damage, but harder to hit. Can only be targeted from the specified directions of the machine.

#### Removed Component
Any component that is not on the Machine, for whatever reason.

#### Shot Off Component
A component is "shot off" if it was removed from the raw damage of a non-elemental attack. This also counts any attack that would usually have a elemental component, but the Hunter decided to ignore.

#### Exploded Component
A component is "exploded" if it was removed with an attack that has a matching elemental component. A component only needs to take half the usual damage to be exploded this way.
EX: a 6 HP Blaze Canister only needs 3 damage and a fire component on the attack (like a fire arrow) to trigger an explosion.

#### Difficulty X Encounter
The selected difficulty by the Leader at the beginning of the encounter, from 1 to 3.
